# Simulation of Metastable problem through AMS

This project is divided in multiple steps:

Step 1 — Naïve Monte Carlo Simulation
Step 2 — Adaptive Multilevel Splitting (AMS) #TODO
Step 3 — Committor Function Approximation #TODO
Step 4 — AMS with Committor as Score #TODO
Step 5 — Validation & Extensions #TODO
